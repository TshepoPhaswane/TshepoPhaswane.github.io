            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>My latest project was a full-stack Android application designed for counselling. It connects users with professional psychologists trained to help with any psychological challenges. The app was developed using PHP for the backend, Java for the Android frontend, and MySQL for database management. It provides a seamless user experience for those seeking mental health support.</p>
